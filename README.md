# CS313-GraphGUI
This was a project where I was able to create a GUI in java that added and removed vertices and edges.
The most interesting part of the code is located in the Connected Components and Cut Vertices part of the code.
Everything other part of the code consists of mostly structuring the GUI code. This was still an interesting project to create.
